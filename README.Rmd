Practical R/data-wrangling **Tips** and **Tricks**: custom functions, regex, and iteration.  Learn techniques for common needs such as data-scraping, ingesting multiple files, transforming messy data into tidy data, quickly cleaning column names, separating multi-value fields, uniting variable values, and nesting data. 

## Applied topics  

- File handling: ingesting multiple CSV files ; multi-value fields  
- Regular expressions and pattern matching: working with strings  
    - `if_else()` and `case_when()`  
- Custom functions: leverage R as a _functional coding_ language  
- Nesting data-frames: preparing to iterate over list columns  
- Data wrangling case study with Excel; how to use `fill()`("fill down") and `pivot_longer()`
